A mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life.<br/ >
Very common - More than 3 million US cases per yearSymptoms-Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes.<br/ >
Depression symptoms in children and teens-Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.<br/ >
In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.<br/ >
In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.<br/ >
Depression symptoms in older adults-Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help.<br/ >
Treatment consists of antidepressants-The mainstay of treatment is usually medication, talk therapy, or a combination of the two. Increasingly, research suggests these treatments may normalize brain changes associated with depression.

Prevention-There's no sure way to prevent depression. However, these strategies may help.<br/ >
Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem.<br/ >
Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.<br/ >
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening.<br/ >
Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.<br/ >
