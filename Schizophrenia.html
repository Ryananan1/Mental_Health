A disorder that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly.
<br/ >
More than 200,000 US cases per year.Schizophrenia affects more than 23 million people worldwide but is not as common as many other mental disorders.
<br/ >
Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:

Withdrawal from friends and family
A drop in performance at school
Trouble sleeping
Irritability or depressed mood
Lack of motivation
<br/ >
Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be:

Less likely to have delusions
More likely to have visual hallucinations.
<br/>
There's no sure way to prevent schizophrenia, but sticking with the treatment plan can help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. In addition, researchers hope that learning more about risk factors for schizophrenia may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.<br/ >
